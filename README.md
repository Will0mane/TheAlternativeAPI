# TheAlternativeAPI
This A.P.I. is meant to be a simple helper for any developer that is struggling with Formats, Builders, Serializers and more!

Made for Minecraft 1.17 specifically but meant to work with a lot of more versions.

If you realize something is wrong in some versions please tell me and i will try to fix.

On this first release I added a Simple ItemStack builder with many options.

The data part on the builder is still in development. 

Please note that this is an ALPHA release. There may be bugs or malfunctionalities.

The Documentation will come along with the next release.
